# Loadster Chrome Extension

This is the source code for the [Loadster Recorder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loadster-recorder/bkhfnmahbfjemfpgehoolkhhdhbidaan) extension in the Chrome Web Store.

Its purpose is to assist you with load test script creation by recording your browser activity (when enabled) and sharing it with your locally running instance of Loadster Workbench.

Loadster Workbench then collates the browser events into a Loadster script, which you can then edit and play back in Loadster Workbench. Once you're satisfied with your script, you can launch a load test with hundreds or thousands of current users running your script simultaneously.

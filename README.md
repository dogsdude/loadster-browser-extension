# Loadster Recorder Browser Extension

This is the source code for the Loadster Recorder extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loadster-recorder/bkhfnmahbfjemfpgehoolkhhdhbidaan) and coming soon to the Firefox Add-ons Directory.

Its purpose is to assist you with load test script creation by recording your browser activity (when enabled) and sharing it with [Loadster](https://loadster.app).

Loadster then collates the browser events into a load test script, which you can then edit and play back repeatedly. Once you're satisfied with your script, launch a load test with hundreds or thousands of current users running your script simultaneously!

To learn more about Loadster and load testing in general, check out [Loadster](https://loadster.app).
